# python-crackmes/obfuscated python code
I've created some python crackmes.  

Some crackmes (or shall I call them obfuscated python code :)) in the beginner levels may seem complicated but they aren't!  
Use a bit of your time and figure it out. They aren't that hard, trust me.  

# How to solve

Most of them require an user input to check the key so you could run the program

# Find out without executing

Some people asked me if they could edit the code.  
You are **allowed** to edit the code in Fowe in order to deobfuscate but you are not allowed to execute the program itself.  
Basically you can do everything you want with the program except executing.  
Hope that clears everything!  

# Difficulties

The folder name is the difficulty level of the crackme  

| Difficulty | Comment |
| --- | --- | 
| Easy |  | 
| Beginner |  | 
| Normal | | 
| Hard | not yet implemented | 
| Expert | not yet implemented | 
| Find out without executing | You have to find out what the program does **without** executing the program itself. Your key/flag shall be the name of the algorithm! | 
| Experimental | These are new crackmes where I am not sure if they are good how they are. You can still try to solve them and give me some feedback on it |
